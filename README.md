# Visage - 2020
The first fps game I tried to develop.

After playing Dead Space and Half Life, I was very inspired to make a dark sci-fi fps game. This project was also my introduction to working with 3D graphics, where I used Blender to model and texture the assets (I still use Blender to this day).

My goal was originally to create a dark and eerie scifi game, but after a while it slowly shifted into a movement shooter after I played a game called Ghostrunner.

The style of the game shifted dramatically from ps1 style gritty visuals, to colorful cell-shaded graphics.

This project tough me a lot about the asset pipeline of creating something in an external program like Blender, and importing it to Unity.

Here is a screenshot of a weapon I initially wanted to add, before the style-shift:

Here is a screenshot from the POV of the player after the styleshift (the weapon is very reminiscent of Ghostrunner).

Unfortunately the Unity files for this project are lost to time, and there are some recent builds of the project, but they are broken and don't allow for user input.

I will also upload the assets and blender files I used to create the visuals.
